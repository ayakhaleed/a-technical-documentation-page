        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;</p>

         <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
         <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

       <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
         <header class="main-header">hello world</header>
         <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
  
         <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " +yourName); }<br>greetMe("World");</code>
        
         <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
         
       </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
          <header class="main-header">declaring variables</header>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>
With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <code>var x = 42.</code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>
By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>          
         <code>x = 42.</code>
         <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br>
With the keyword let. For example,</p>
         <code>let y = 13.</code>
        </section>
         <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
           <header class="main-header">variable scope</header>
           <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function</p>
           <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
           <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
         </section>
       <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header class="main-header">data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul id="out-list">
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:
            <ul id="in-list">
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
              <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
